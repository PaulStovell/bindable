[Title: Application Model]
    
    This stage takes the goals and requirements that arise from the solution design process - such as the necessity for 
    modular applications, or the need for localization - and designs the solutions for them. This stage should focus on themes 
    that affect the application as a whole, rather than specific features. In the end, the design for a lightweight framework 
    should emerge. Once the ubiquitous language has been decided, this is the time to open Visual Studio and prototype like 
    mad. 

    In an Agile process, I'd suggest only picking features and areas that are known to be in the features for the current 
    iteration.
