[Title: Domain Model]

    This stage is performed concurrently with the application model, with the two feeding into each other. Until the View 
    Specification Process is completed, I'd recommend that this stick to small sketches and conceptual models and lists of 
    services, rather than a thorough implementation, as it's likely that UI implementation requirements will have an effect 
    on the intricacies of the domain model. 
    
    Also note that it is often fine, and in some cases desired, that an application may have multiple seperate domain models. 
    
    Following an Agile process, the entities modelled in this process should at most only model the objects in the current 
    iteration and possibly the next.
