[Title: Client Architecture]

    Typical projects follow an SDLC that seperates the roles of team members and sees them working on different 
    artifacts during the architecture and development process. It is my belief that these processes should be 
    more collaborative. For example, Business Analysis often work on Functional Specifications which provide a 
    functional overview of the implementation of the application, down to the level of detailing every field on 
    a form. But these documents generally don't provide the level of detail required by developers, and nor do 
    they easily lend themselves to being designed by interaction designers. Instead, I advocate a collaborative 
    approach, where such designs are worked on by business analysis, developers and architects together, at least 
    during the initial envisioning of the application.
