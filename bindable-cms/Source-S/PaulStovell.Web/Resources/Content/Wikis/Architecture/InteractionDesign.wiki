[Title: Interaction Design]
 
    This stage turns the requirements captured above into a framework for a solution. This stage is primarily owned 
    by interaction designers, with heavy involvement from business analysts, customer advocates and users or user 
    representitives. Developers and architects should also have an involvement at this point to help guide interaction 
    designers in terms of what's possible with technology. 
     
    I feel that solution design should be owned by interaction designers because it is the best way to create a 
    consistent, user-centric experience.
