[Title: Solution Design Requirements]

    This stage is owned by business analysts and centers around capturing the requirements, histories, experiences 
    and processes of the users of the systems and their expectations. While many ideas for solutions will arise at 
    this time, it is important to capture the requirements at a higher level (the problem), rather than to dictate 
    how a screen or view should look (a solution). Interaction Designers and architects should be involved during 
    this process to ensure all of their requirements are fulfilled.
