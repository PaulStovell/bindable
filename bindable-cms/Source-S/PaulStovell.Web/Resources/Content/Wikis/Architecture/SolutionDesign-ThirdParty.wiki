[Title: Third Party Components]
[Parent: SolutionDesign]

    When designing applications we are often faced with the decision of building specific functionality ourselves, or seeking third 
    party offerings. Here are a list of key things to keep in mind when evaluating a third party component:
    
    - *Test for memory leaks*. I have had bad experiences with some of the components below in the past where references to items that 
      should have been garbage collected are still in memory. Jared Roughan and I had plenty of fun dealing with memory leaks caused by SyncFusion's 
      refusal to release references to tabs that had been closed. Try to know these issues before you commit. 
    - *Review their styling and theming capabilities*. I have found Infragistics controls to follow WPF conventions well, using merged resource 
      dictionaries for theming. SyncFusion on the other hand appeared to have used their own styling system, which resulted in many thousands 
      of lines of XAML. 
    - *You don't have to use every control in a suite*. Control suites are attractive, but don't fall into the habit of using every control in a 
      suite if they do not add value.
    - *Honestly consider the build option*. The controls below are built to support many edge cases, but your own needs may be more limited. 
      Controls such as the Outlook Bar or MDI Tab controls below could typically be built by a competent WPF developer in less than a day or 
      two.
