[Title: Solution Design]

    The interaction design has now dictated what the end product will be look like, and the solution design document will 
    outline how it will be built. This stage should focus on higher level trends and common themes in the application - will 
    it be modular, will it use a lot of background threads, will it interact with many web services. The goal is to capture 
    these requirements and gauge the solutions, without designing the solutions in depth (UML diagrams or code are way too 
    low-level at this point).

    This stage is primarily in the domain of architects.
