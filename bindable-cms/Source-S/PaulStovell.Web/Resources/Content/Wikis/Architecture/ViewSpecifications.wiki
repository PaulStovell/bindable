[Title: View Specifications]

    This process enables developers to translate the wireframes from the interaction design, and the architectural 
    framework from the application model and domain model, and gives everyone on the team a clear, agreed upon path 
    as to how a view will be implemented.

    For the current iteration, I would gather all of the views and workflows that are required, and then turn each one into 
    a document. This is the point at which BA's would describe the role of every field on a form, architects would train 
    developers in the framework, missing styles, templates, or functionality in the architecture would be identified, and 
    developers would plan the general approach to implementing a form.

    I expect that during the first iteration, or at least the first few views, this process will be owned by architects. Over 
    time, it would be best for developers to take control. I imagine that this would be done in parallel with BA's and 
    testers - as a BA completes the requirements of the view, a developer and architect begin to design the implementation,
     and the testers then begin to plan the test cases.

    Each view should have a clear owner in terms of a BA, Tester, Developer and architect or lead developer responsible for it. 
    Where a view is used by other views, those teams should collaborate on the designs.
